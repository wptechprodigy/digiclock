This is another project inspired by Tenzen. A great guy.

This is a Digital Clock App, named DigiClock.

It displays current time and ticks by each seconds. It auto-updates itself.

I developed this on my Tecno Droipad Pro II. Used CLI for the creation of all files...

Termux thanks for providing me with the CLI utility to work directly from my tab,
and I do not have to wait for my bad laptop.

I manipulated the DOM and used ```new Date()``` Javascript function.

It's a fun project and I am glad I was able to go this alone
after insights from Tenzen.

Thanks man...you are doing a great job.

You are welcomed to use this however you want. You can even suggest a use or a better way to go about it.

I welcome any suggestions, corrections and request for improvements.

Regards.
